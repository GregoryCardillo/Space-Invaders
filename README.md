I recreated a Web Version of the very popular late 70's game Space Invaders.
A useful exercise especially for experimenting with game development dynamics in Javascript.
The game is fully playable locally

Here's a DEMO:

Space Invaders is a fixed shooter in which the player moves a laser cannon horizontally across the bottom of the screen and fires at aliens overhead. 
The aliens begin as two rows of three that move left and right as a group,
shifting downward (advancing on the shooter) each time they reach a screen edge. 
The goal is to eliminate all of the aliens by shooting them.
